# Hyper Battery Monitor

A lightweight Windows system tray application for monitoring the battery, charging, connection, and microphone mute status of supported **HyperX wireless headsets**.

The application provides a convenient way to monitor your headset directly from the Windows notification area, without requiring a full companion application to remain open.

## Features

* 🔋 Battery level monitoring directly from the Windows system tray
* ⏳ Estimated remaining battery time, with locally saved discharge history per headset model
* 🎧 Support for multiple HyperX wireless headsets

## What's New in Version 2.3.0

* **Five new devices:** Cloud Flight S, Cloud Flight Wireless, Cloud Stinger Core Wireless + 7.1, Cloud Flight 2 (Dedicated Dongle), and Cloud Mix 2.
* **Automatic device detection:** visual progress and guidance when no compatible device or multiple devices are found.
* **Clear connection requirements:** Cloud III S and Cloud Flight 2 are labeled as requiring a Dedicated Dongle. A detected HyperX Three-In-One receiver is identified as an unsupported connection; monitoring through TIO is not supported.
* **Updated Device page:** supported features, connection information, and battery information in a revised layout.
* **More robust remaining-time estimates:** each session starts from nominal battery life and gradually incorporates validated discharge windows. Incompatible old history is reset, and implausible readings are filtered.
* **Localization improvements:** updated English, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish text.

Remaining-time estimates are approximate and hidden while charging or disconnected.

## Headset Status Monitoring

Hyper Battery Monitor displays battery, charging, connection, and supported microphone mute information.

### Microphone mute monitoring

Supported headsets can report their microphone mute state directly to Hyper Battery Monitor.

The microphone state is displayed in:

* The device monitor in the Settings sidebar
* The system tray context menu
* The system tray tooltip

The application displays whether the microphone is:

* **Open**
* **Muted**
* **N/A** (localized) until a supported headset reports its microphone state, or when unavailable

When microphone mute indication is enabled, the system tray icon alternates between the current battery-status icon and the microphone-mute icon while the microphone is muted.

When the microphone is unmuted, the tray returns to displaying only the current battery-status icon.

Microphone mute monitoring is available on Cloud III Wireless, Cloud III S (Dedicated Dongle), Cloud 2 Core, Cloud Alpha, Cloud Flight 2 (Dedicated Dongle), and Cloud Mix 2. See the feature matrix below for all models.

### Improved charging monitoring

Charging-state support has been expanded across the supported headset implementations.

When a headset is charging, Hyper Battery Monitor can indicate the charging state through the system tray and device monitoring interface.

The sidebar and tray menu indicate charging through the battery icon when applicable.

### Improved device monitoring

The device monitor now provides a more complete overview of the current headset state:

* Connection status
* Battery percentage
* Charging state
* Microphone state, when supported

The same information is also available from the system tray context menu and tooltip.

## Supported Devices

Ten headset models are currently supported. Feature availability is shown below.

### Feature availability

| Device | Battery | Charging | Microphone Mute |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| HyperX Cloud III Wireless | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HyperX Cloud III S **(Dedicated Dongle)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HyperX Cloud 2 Core | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Cloud III S and Cloud Flight 2 require their Dedicated Dongle.** HyperX Three-In-One (TIO) receiver presence is detected only to explain that this connection is not yet supported for monitoring.

Cloud Mix 2 supports battery and microphone mute monitoring; charging-state monitoring is unavailable.

## Requirements

* Windows 10 or later
* .NET 10 (included in the self-contained installer)

## Installation

Download the latest version from the **Releases** section of this repository.

For version 2.3.1, download:

[HyperBatteryMonitor-Setup-v2.3.1.exe](https://github.com/davidsantanaalves/HyperXBatteryMonitor/releases/download/v2.3.1/HyperBatteryMonitor-Setup-v2.3.1.exe)

Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

After installation, Hyper Battery Monitor runs in the Windows system tray.

You can also install Hyper Battery Monitor from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N4G6WKMM4QJ).

## Usage

After launching the application, the Hyper Battery Monitor icon will appear in the Windows notification area.

Right-click the tray icon to access the device status and available options.

Double-click the tray icon to open the application settings.

Use automatic detection with your headset powered on and connected, or select a model manually. If several compatible headsets are detected, select the desired model manually.

Selecting a headset previews its status in Settings. Click Apply or OK to save the selection and use it for system tray monitoring.

From the Settings window you can configure:

* Device
* Battery monitor mode
* Battery colors
* Battery color gradient
* Charging indication
* Critical battery notification
* Fully charged notification
* Critical battery tray-icon blinking
* Microphone mute tray indication
* Language
* Theme
* Start with Windows

Microphone-related options are automatically unavailable for headset models that do not support microphone mute monitoring.

## Battery Monitor Modes

Hyper Battery Monitor provides multiple ways to display battery information in the Windows system tray.

### Static icon

Displays the standard headset icon, with a separate charging indication when applicable.

### Dynamic glow icon

Displays a glow around the headset icon using predefined battery-level colors.

The default battery ranges are:

* ≥ 50% — Green
* 30–49% — Yellow
* 15–29% — Orange
* < 15% — Red
* Charging — Charging indicator

### Custom dynamic icon

Customize battery-level colors and thresholds, with an optional gradient transition.

## Microphone Monitoring

For supported headsets, Hyper Battery Monitor monitors microphone mute-state changes and updates the interface automatically.

The current microphone state can be viewed in:

* Settings sidebar
* System tray menu
* System tray tooltip

When **Show muted microphone in the system tray** is enabled, the tray icon alternates between:

1. The current battery-status icon
2. The microphone-mute icon

This continues while the microphone remains muted.

When the microphone becomes active again, the tray displays only the normal battery-status icon.

This feature is enabled by default for headset models that support microphone mute monitoring.

## Charging Status

Hyper Battery Monitor monitors charging state on supported devices.

When charging is detected, the application can:

* Display a charging-specific tray icon or charging indicator
* Show the charging state in the device monitoring interface
* Indicate charging through the battery icon in the sidebar and tray menu
* Notify the user when the headset reaches full charge

Charging behavior depends on the selected battery display mode.

## Notifications

The application can notify you when the headset reaches the configured critical battery level.

A fully charged notification can also be displayed when the headset finishes charging.

Available notification-related options include:

* Low battery notification
* Configurable critical battery level
* Critical battery tray-icon blinking
* Fully charged notification
* Microphone mute tray indication on supported headsets

These options can be configured independently through the Settings window.
